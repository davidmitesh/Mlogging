## Idea about the Dapp

Mlogging is a Dapp that aims to redefine the way how vlogging is performed.Vloggers can create blogs with the added feature of tracking the route in the map and also mark the important locations on the way making the viewers more enhanced experience of following up with the vlog.
While in the process, as the vlog gets more popular among viewers, advertisers can put advertisements on them by directly paying incentives to the creator through the Dapp in a decentralized and distributed  way using smart contract.
In this manner, the vlog creator gets fully credited for his work and viewers can get quality contents.

## Unique features about Mlogging

* As opposed to most of the Dapps targetted for web(browser specific), this Dapp is targeted for mobile device as to make blockchain Dapps widely adopted, it is very crucial to
bring the platform to mobile environment.
* React Native is used for making cross platform mobile Dapp.
* Mini wallet like feature is implemented inside the Dapp which is built using Truffle-HDwallet provider.
* Matic Network is used for public blockchain network making the transactions very fast giving users the smooth experience like of normal apps.
* For now MongoDB and IPFS collectively serves as for backend for Dapp while account information is maintained in blockchain making the Dapp pseudo-decentralized.
However, [AvionDB](https://github.com/dappkit/aviondb) will be used later to make the Dapp fully decentralized.
